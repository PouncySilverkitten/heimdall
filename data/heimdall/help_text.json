To invoke my powers:\n  -!stats (--aliases) will return a set of statistics about the one who summons me\n  -!stats @user (--aliases) shall direct my gaze upon @user instead\n  The following options can be used with all commands above: --messages, --engagement, --text\n    - --messages (-m)\n      This performs analysis on the messages sent by a user - their first message, last message, average number of messages per day, and so on.\n    - --engagement (-e)\n      This analyses the users that the user most commonly interacts with. It shows a table of the ten most-engaged with users, and the user's self-engagement score.\n    - --text (-t)\n      This performs textual analysis on a random sampling of the messages sent by a user.\n\n  -!rank shall cause me to say where you do stand in the ranking of our citizens\n  -!rank @user shall again direct my gaze upon @user\n\n  -!roomstats causes me to ponder the fine and worthy history of &{}\n  - !roomstats &room will cause me to ponder the history of said room instead\n\nI shall also assist you in finding messages lost to the fog of time, though only in &test:\n  - !query message text will search for the messages containing \"message text\".\n  - !query-concat message text will cause me to search for messages containing \"message\" and \"text\".\n  To each of the above, the query !sender name can be appended, so that only messages by that sender will be returned.\n\nI am watched over by the one known as Pouncy Silverkitten, and my inner workings may be seen at https://github.com/PouncySilverkitten/heimdall. I wouldn't be able to do a tonne of the cool stuff I can do without the expertise of Garmy."}
